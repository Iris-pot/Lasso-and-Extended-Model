## 2 Project Practice

This project uses a shared bicycle use data set on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-demand/data) to predict the amount of use of bicycle sharing in Washington in the United States.

Mainly using the Sklearn library in Python, using linear regression, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, Elastic Net, and Adaptive Lasso models to fit the data, and then compare the RMSE and score values of the model.

The relevant code of this project is also published on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/myzhai/bike-shaRing-lasso-RasticNet-Adaptivelasso).
